7.About (Short Description / Summary):VIRTUAL MARKETING (VMARK) is an ANDROID application developed using an emerging concept AUGMENTED REALITY.  Augmented reality is a new and advanced technology which provides the users an amazing visual experience by integrating VIRTUAL OBJECTS with REAL ENTITIES in a real-time environment. Thus this application uses the AR-concept for giving a new and more interactive experience in marketing. This application works on the basic notion that it generates a 3d model of a specific product when its corresponding marker is scanned and detected. This marker is technically known as the target-marker which will be unique that is totally different from one another. Each and every model for its corresponding product will be assigned to a marker. These collections of marker and its model will be safely and comfortably stored in a database which is maintained in a server. When the user opens the application , camera gets activated and it scans for the available marker in its vision. At once when a marker gets detected it make a quick match with all the available markers in the database. When it finally recognizes the valid marker the model stored for the corresponding marker will be retrieved from the database. Then the retrieved 3-D model will be generated and displayed on the application in real-time. The generated model will get positioned with reference to the world co-ordinates of the target marker.
